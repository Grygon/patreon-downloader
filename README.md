# Patreon Downloader

Built to scrape your email for all Patreon posts, find all the content you may want in them, and download it for convenient local sorting and use.

Specifically built for downloading from RPG creators, but should work pretty well for most creators posting downloadable files.

Does not and will never scrape a creator's profile for all their posts to download. I didn't create this so you only have to be on their Patreon for a month and grab everything, this is built to make it more convenient to use works from your favorite creators.

## Setup

To run locally, first install Python and clone the repo.

`git clone git@github.com:Grygon/patreon-downloader.git`

Then, install module requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, take your `example.env` and rename it to `.env`. Fill out all the placeholder values as you go.

Finally, run main.py. I suggest running it in your terminal of choice so you can watch the output scroll by

` python main.py `
